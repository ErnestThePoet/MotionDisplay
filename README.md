# MotionDisplay
Want to measure the G-load when your flight is taking off? Try this interesting tool. It shows motion data(GPS speed, 3-axis acceleration and total acceleration) on your Android screen. As mobile phone sensors are cheap and not so accurate, **DO NOT use it for anything that matters.**
## Motion Data
The displayed motion data are(from top screen to bottom):
- GPS speed
- Longitudinal acceleration
- Lateral acceleration
- Vertical acceleration
- Total acceleration
